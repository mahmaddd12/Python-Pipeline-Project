# Python-Pipeline-Project
I was able to run through the first 3 steps, however I kept on getting errors on the SPAdes script due to the the reads not being the same length. I tried to mitigate this by truncating the reads so they could be the same length, but still got the same errors. 

Therefore my wrapper script won't work, and I wasn't able to test if my analyze_contigs script and blast_analysis scripts will work.
